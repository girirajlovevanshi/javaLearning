//Primitive data type in java
//byte,short,int,long,float,double,boolean and char

// byte: The byte data type is an 8-bit signed two's complement integer.
// It has a minimum value of -128 and a maximum value of 127 (inclusive).
byte byteNum = 100;

//short: The short data type is a 16-bit signed two's complement integer. 
//It has a minimum value of -32,768 and a maximum value of 32,767 (inclusive).
short shortNum = 30000;

//int: The int data type is a 32-bit signed two's complement integer,
// which has a minimum value of -2^31 and a maximum value of 2^31-1.
int intNum = 100000;

//long: The long data type is a 64-bit two's complement integer. 
//The signed long has a minimum value of -2^63 and a maximum value of 2^63-1.
long longNum = 10000000000L;

//float: The float data type is a single-precision 32-bit IEEE 754 floating point. 
//Use a float (instead of double) if you need to save memory in large arrays of floating point numbers.
float floatNum = 20.5f;

//double: The double data type is a double-precision 64-bit IEEE 754 floating point.
// For decimal values, this data type is generally the default choice.
double doubleNum = 100.5;

//char: The char data type is a single 16-bit Unicode character.
// It has a minimum value of '\u0000' (or 0) and a maximum value of '\uffff' (or 65,535 inclusive).
char letter = 'A';
