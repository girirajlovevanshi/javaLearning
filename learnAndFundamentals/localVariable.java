/*
 * Here's a breakdown:

localVariable: This is the name of the class you're creating an instance of.

main: This is the variable name you're assigning the new instance to. After this line of code, you can use main to access methods and variables within the localVariable instance.

new: This is a Java keyword that creates a new instance of a class.

localVariable(): This is a call to the localVariable class's constructor, which initializes the new object.

So, localVariable main = new localVariable(); creates a new object of type localVariable and assigns its reference to the variable main.

Please note that according to Java naming conventions, class names should start with a capital letter. So it's recommended to name your class LocalVariable instead of localVariable.
